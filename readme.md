Start of a Framework
- we might want to make another app
- or integrate two or more app within a larger one
- We would have to redefine certain, more general purpose methods
  in each app
- the is where framework comes in

Goal: Create a small framework to hold the common methods
that we may want to use between different web applications


Step 1: response and erb looks prime for the little framework
 - create monroe.rb
- create a class Monroe  in the file
